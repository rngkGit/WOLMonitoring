## About The Project

WOLMonitorin was created to provide a simple, clean, and powerful interface for managing your personal computers, home servers, or work machines directly from your phone. This app keeps all your machine information organized and accessible, with powerful network tools planned for the future.

Built entirely with SwiftUI, the app is designed to be fast and easy to use while being descriptive and useful.

### Built With

* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* [Google Gemini AI](https://gemini.google.com/app/)

## Features

### Current-ish Features
* **Device Management:** Easily add, edit (kinda), and delete computers from your list.
* **Detailed Information:** Store essential details for each machine, including a nickname, MAC address, and (soon) custom notes.
* **Local Persistence:** Your device list is securely saved on your device.

### Upcoming Features
*  **Wake-On-LAN (WOL):** Power on your computers remotely from anywhere with an internet connection (may require a remote VPN and separate host machine).
*  **Remote Sensor Reading:** Monitor hardware stats like CPU temperature, fan speeds, and memory usage (will require a companion agent on the host machine).
*  **Live Status Pinging:** See at a glance which machines on your network are online or offline.
*  **Notifications:** Recieve notifications regarding your machines such as new power status, high temperatures, and more.
*  **iCloud Sync:** Keep your computer list synchronized across all your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac).
